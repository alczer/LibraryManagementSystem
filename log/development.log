Since you're loading it in a web browser, we assume that you expected to actually render a template, not nothing, so we're showing an error to be extra-clear. If you expect 204 No Content, carry on. That's what you'll get from an XHR or API request. Give it a shot.):

Choroba afektywna-dwubiegunowa, z którą zmaga się od wielu lat, powoduje, że jej życie wciąż przypomina sinusoidę i nie pozwala na ustatkowanie i spełnianie marzeń. Kobieta obiecuje sobie, że tym razem nie pozwoli na to, by kolejny rzut manii, zamieniony w falę depresji zrujnowały jej zdrowie i plany. Przyjmuje nowy lek, którego działanie pozwala jej myśleć o przyszłości w nieco jaśniejszych barwach. Wraca do Warszawy i po pierwszych przykrych wydarzeniach udaje jej się znaleźć pracę i życzliwych ludzi, którzy wyciągają do niej pomocną dłoń. Jednak mimo tych nadziei i dobrego samopoczucia, jej spokój zostaje nagle zburzony przez bardzo niepokojące przywidzenia, a gdy na jej drodze staje przystojny książę z krwi i kości, wszystko zaczyna komplikować się jeszcze bardziej. Kasia staje przed wyzwaniem, jakim jest poznanie siebie, swojej przykrej przeszłości, a jednocześnie pogodzenie się z tym, kim naprawdę jest. Losy kobiety splatają się z innymi osobami, które także zmagają się z licznymi problemami i dzięki niej powoli zaczynają odkrywać swoją tożsamość.

Tylko od nas zależy, jaką drogą pójdziemy\n- Redakcja William Irwin, Gregory Bassham\n\nKlucz do zaszyfrowanego świata filozofii\n\nOpowieści o Harrym Potterze opanowały serca i umysły milionów dzieciaków na całym świecie. Nie oszukujmy się – również wielu dorosłych dało się zaczarować książkom J.K. Rowling. Dlaczego? Może to wspomnienie dzieciństwa, a może ta wszechobecna aura niezwykłości: ukryte komnaty, duchy, magiczne przedmioty kontrolujące umysły, mroczne tajemnice z przeszłości, wilkołaki, myślodsiewnia, a nawet kamień filozoficzny… Albo fakt, że kiedy wczytać się dokładnie, powieść ta ukazuje nam wielkie bogactwo bardzo kontrowersyjnych treści.\nPrzysięgam uroczyście, że knuję coś niedobrego.\n\nSeria książek o młodocianym czarodzieju od samego początku budziła niezwykle silne emocje. Oskarżana o szerzenie magii i okultyzmu, była nawet ostentacyjnie palona, tak jak zakazane księgi w czasach Wielkiej Inkwizycji. Niektórzy uwierzyli w wykreowaną przez autorkę rzeczywistość, jeszcze inni uznali, że to po prostu świetna rozrywka. Jeśli Ty również jesteś fanem Harry”ego Pottera, jeśli ta magiczna rzeczywistość wciąż Cię pociąga i nęci, chcemy pokazać coś, co prawdopodobnie przeoczyłeś w trakcie lektury.\n\nZobacz świat Harry”ego z innej perspektywy. Odnajdź przekaz ukryty między wierszami. Niektóre z tych zagadnień czy idei wydadzą Ci się rewolucyjne, inne możesz uznać za niedorzeczne, jeszcze inne zafascynują Cię swoim geniuszem. Jedno jest pewne – powtórnie przeżyjesz niezwykłą przygodę, zanurzając się jeszcze głębiej w tę krainę czarów…\nKomnata Tajemnic została otwarta!!!"], ["isbn", 9788373331270], ["language", "polski"], ["state", "bardzo dobry"], ["date_pub", "2007-01-01"], ["item_img_file_name", "harripotta_img.jpg"], ["item_img_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["item_img_file_size", 59705], ["item_img_updated_at", "2007-01-01 10:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-06-06 07:04:24.877469"], ["updated_at", "2017-06-06 07:04:24.877469"], ["publisher_id", 29]]

Ich dom trzeszczał w szwach od przygarniętych psów i kotów. Kiedy więc Steve otrzymał propozycję zaopiekowania się jeszcze jedną biedną sierotką – świnką miniaturką – nie walczyli ze sobą zbyt długo. Wkrótce jednak odkryli, że ktoś wywinął im niezły numer i że ich mała chrumkająca córeczka zmienia się w pełnowymiarową, ważącą niemal trzysta kilogramów nastolatkę. A to oznaczało, że muszą poważnie przeorganizować swoje życie.\nZa sprawą Esther Steve i Derek nie tylko przestali jeść bekon (za którym przepadali). Obaj zostali wegetarianami, potem weganami, ale czuli, że coś jeszcze zostało im zrobienia. Kiedy więc Esther przestała się mieścić w wannie i na kanapie, kupili farmę, by ich świnka miała gdzie ryć i się tarzać – a następnie założyli schronisko dla zwierząt gospodarskich, znane dziś pod nazwą Happily Ever Esther (Długo i Szczęśliwie z Esther). Ta wzruszająca i zabawna historia pokazuje, jak dwóch zwykłych chłopaków z przerażonych rodziców zastępczych rezolutnej świni stało się obrońcami praw zwierząt.

Ale śmiertelna seria dopiero się zaczęła, a kolejne zabójstwo będzie najbardziej szokujące ze wszystkich… "], ["isbn", 9788379611270], ["language", "polski"], ["state", "bardzo zły"], ["date_pub", "2010-08-06"], ["item_img_file_name", "im1.jpg"], ["item_img_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["item_img_file_size", 82610], ["item_img_updated_at", "2009-01-01 10:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-06-06 07:04:25.109818"], ["updated_at", "2017-06-06 07:04:25.109818"], ["publisher_id", 31]]

Choroba afektywna-dwubiegunowa, z którą zmaga się od wielu lat, powoduje, że jej życie wciąż przypomina sinusoidę i nie pozwala na ustatkowanie i spełnianie marzeń. Kobieta obiecuje sobie, że tym razem nie pozwoli na to, by kolejny rzut manii, zamieniony w falę depresji zrujnowały jej zdrowie i plany. Przyjmuje nowy lek, którego działanie pozwala jej myśleć o przyszłości w nieco jaśniejszych barwach. Wraca do Warszawy i po pierwszych przykrych wydarzeniach udaje jej się znaleźć pracę i życzliwych ludzi, którzy wyciągają do niej pomocną dłoń. Jednak mimo tych nadziei i dobrego samopoczucia, jej spokój zostaje nagle zburzony przez bardzo niepokojące przywidzenia, a gdy na jej drodze staje przystojny książę z krwi i kości, wszystko zaczyna komplikować się jeszcze bardziej. Kasia staje przed wyzwaniem, jakim jest poznanie siebie, swojej przykrej przeszłości, a jednocześnie pogodzenie się z tym, kim naprawdę jest. Losy kobiety splatają się z innymi osobami, które także zmagają się z licznymi problemami i dzięki niej powoli zaczynają odkrywać swoją tożsamość.

Tylko od nas zależy, jaką drogą pójdziemy\n- Redakcja William Irwin, Gregory Bassham\n\nKlucz do zaszyfrowanego świata filozofii\n\nOpowieści o Harrym Potterze opanowały serca i umysły milionów dzieciaków na całym świecie. Nie oszukujmy się – również wielu dorosłych dało się zaczarować książkom J.K. Rowling. Dlaczego? Może to wspomnienie dzieciństwa, a może ta wszechobecna aura niezwykłości: ukryte komnaty, duchy, magiczne przedmioty kontrolujące umysły, mroczne tajemnice z przeszłości, wilkołaki, myślodsiewnia, a nawet kamień filozoficzny… Albo fakt, że kiedy wczytać się dokładnie, powieść ta ukazuje nam wielkie bogactwo bardzo kontrowersyjnych treści.\nPrzysięgam uroczyście, że knuję coś niedobrego.\n\nSeria książek o młodocianym czarodzieju od samego początku budziła niezwykle silne emocje. Oskarżana o szerzenie magii i okultyzmu, była nawet ostentacyjnie palona, tak jak zakazane księgi w czasach Wielkiej Inkwizycji. Niektórzy uwierzyli w wykreowaną przez autorkę rzeczywistość, jeszcze inni uznali, że to po prostu świetna rozrywka. Jeśli Ty również jesteś fanem Harry”ego Pottera, jeśli ta magiczna rzeczywistość wciąż Cię pociąga i nęci, chcemy pokazać coś, co prawdopodobnie przeoczyłeś w trakcie lektury.\n\nZobacz świat Harry”ego z innej perspektywy. Odnajdź przekaz ukryty między wierszami. Niektóre z tych zagadnień czy idei wydadzą Ci się rewolucyjne, inne możesz uznać za niedorzeczne, jeszcze inne zafascynują Cię swoim geniuszem. Jedno jest pewne – powtórnie przeżyjesz niezwykłą przygodę, zanurzając się jeszcze głębiej w tę krainę czarów…\nKomnata Tajemnic została otwarta!!!"], ["isbn", 9788373331270], ["language", "polski"], ["state", "bardzo dobry"], ["date_pub", "2007-01-01"], ["item_img_file_name", "harripotta_img.jpg"], ["item_img_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["item_img_file_size", 59705], ["item_img_updated_at", "2007-01-01 10:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-06-06 07:11:37.229738"], ["updated_at", "2017-06-06 07:11:37.229738"], ["publisher_id", 35]]

Ich dom trzeszczał w szwach od przygarniętych psów i kotów. Kiedy więc Steve otrzymał propozycję zaopiekowania się jeszcze jedną biedną sierotką – świnką miniaturką – nie walczyli ze sobą zbyt długo. Wkrótce jednak odkryli, że ktoś wywinął im niezły numer i że ich mała chrumkająca córeczka zmienia się w pełnowymiarową, ważącą niemal trzysta kilogramów nastolatkę. A to oznaczało, że muszą poważnie przeorganizować swoje życie.\nZa sprawą Esther Steve i Derek nie tylko przestali jeść bekon (za którym przepadali). Obaj zostali wegetarianami, potem weganami, ale czuli, że coś jeszcze zostało im zrobienia. Kiedy więc Esther przestała się mieścić w wannie i na kanapie, kupili farmę, by ich świnka miała gdzie ryć i się tarzać – a następnie założyli schronisko dla zwierząt gospodarskich, znane dziś pod nazwą Happily Ever Esther (Długo i Szczęśliwie z Esther). Ta wzruszająca i zabawna historia pokazuje, jak dwóch zwykłych chłopaków z przerażonych rodziców zastępczych rezolutnej świni stało się obrońcami praw zwierząt.

Choroba afektywna-dwubiegunowa, z którą zmaga się od wielu lat, powoduje, że jej życie wciąż przypomina sinusoidę i nie pozwala na ustatkowanie i spełnianie marzeń. Kobieta obiecuje sobie, że tym razem nie pozwoli na to, by kolejny rzut manii, zamieniony w falę depresji zrujnowały jej zdrowie i plany. Przyjmuje nowy lek, którego działanie pozwala jej myśleć o przyszłości w nieco jaśniejszych barwach.

Jednak mimo tych nadziei i dobrego samopoczucia, jej spokój zostaje nagle zburzony przez bardzo niepokojące przywidzenia, a gdy na jej drodze staje przystojny książę z krwi i kości, wszystko zaczyna komplikować się jeszcze bardziej.

Losy kobiety splatają się z innymi osobami, które także zmagają się z licznymi problemami i dzięki niej powoli zaczynają odkrywać swoją tożsamość.

Tylko od nas zależy, jaką drogą pójdziemy\n- Redakcja William Irwin, Gregory Bassham\n\nKlucz do zaszyfrowanego świata filozofii\n\nOpowieści o Harrym Potterze opanowały serca i umysły milionów dzieciaków na całym świecie. Nie oszukujmy się – również wielu dorosłych dało się zaczarować książkom J.K. Rowling. Dlaczego? Może to wspomnienie dzieciństwa, a może ta wszechobecna aura niezwykłości: ukryte komnaty, duchy, magiczne przedmioty kontrolujące umysły, mroczne tajemnice z przeszłości, wilkołaki, myślodsiewnia, a nawet kamień filozoficzny… Albo fakt, że kiedy wczytać się dokładnie, powieść ta ukazuje nam wielkie bogactwo bardzo kontrowersyjnych treści.\nPrzysięgam uroczyście, że knuję coś niedobrego.\n\nSeria książek o młodocianym czarodzieju od samego początku budziła niezwykle silne emocje. Oskarżana o szerzenie magii i okultyzmu, była nawet ostentacyjnie palona, tak jak zakazane księgi w czasach Wielkiej Inkwizycji. Niektórzy uwierzyli w wykreowaną przez autorkę rzeczywistość, jeszcze inni uznali, że to po prostu świetna rozrywka. Jeśli Ty również jesteś fanem Harry”ego Pottera, jeśli ta magiczna rzeczywistość wciąż Cię pociąga i nęci, chcemy pokazać coś, co prawdopodobnie przeoczyłeś w trakcie lektury.\n\nZobacz świat Harry”ego z innej perspektywy. Odnajdź przekaz ukryty między wierszami. Niektóre z tych zagadnień czy idei wydadzą Ci się rewolucyjne, inne możesz uznać za niedorzeczne, jeszcze inne zafascynują Cię swoim geniuszem. Jedno jest pewne – powtórnie przeżyjesz niezwykłą przygodę, zanurzając się jeszcze głębiej w tę krainę czarów…\nKomnata Tajemnic została otwarta!!!"], ["isbn", 9788373331270], ["language", "polski"], ["state", "bardzo dobry"], ["date_pub", "2007-01-01"], ["item_img_file_name", "harripotta_img.jpg"], ["item_img_content_type", "image/jpeg"], ["item_img_file_size", 59705], ["item_img_updated_at", "2007-01-01 10:00:00"], ["created_at", "2017-06-06 07:24:17.171092"], ["updated_at", "2017-06-06 07:24:17.171092"], ["publisher_id", 42]]

Ich dom trzeszczał w szwach od przygarniętych psów i kotów. Kiedy więc Steve otrzymał propozycję zaopiekowania się jeszcze jedną biedną sierotką – świnką miniaturką – nie walczyli ze sobą zbyt długo. Wkrótce jednak odkryli, że ktoś wywinął im niezły numer i że ich mała chrumkająca córeczka zmienia się w pełnowymiarową, ważącą niemal trzysta kilogramów nastolatkę. A to oznaczało, że muszą poważnie przeorganizować swoje życie.\nZa sprawą Esther Steve i Derek nie tylko przestali jeść bekon (za którym przepadali). Obaj zostali wegetarianami, potem weganami, ale czuli, że coś jeszcze zostało im zrobienia. Kiedy więc Esther przestała się mieścić w wannie i na kanapie, kupili farmę, by ich świnka miała gdzie ryć i się tarzać – a następnie założyli schronisko dla zwierząt gospodarskich, znane dziś pod nazwą Happily Ever Esther (Długo i Szczęśliwie z Esther). Ta wzruszająca i zabawna historia pokazuje, jak dwóch zwykłych chłopaków z przerażonych rodziców zastępczych rezolutnej świni stało się obrońcami praw zwierząt.

Choroba afektywna-dwubiegunowa, z którą zmaga się od wielu lat, powoduje, że jej życie wciąż przypomina sinusoidę i nie pozwala na ustatkowanie i spełnianie marzeń. Kobieta obiecuje sobie, że tym razem nie pozwoli na to, by kolejny rzut manii, zamieniony w falę depresji zrujnowały jej zdrowie i plany. Przyjmuje nowy lek, którego działanie pozwala jej myśleć o przyszłości w nieco jaśniejszych barwach. Wraca do Warszawy i po pierwszych przykrych wydarzeniach udaje jej się znaleźć pracę i życzliwych ludzi, którzy wyciągają do niej pomocną dłoń. Jednak mimo tych nadziei i dobrego samopoczucia, jej spokój zostaje nagle zburzony przez bardzo niepokojące przywidzenia, a gdy na jej drodze staje przystojny książę z krwi i kości, wszystko zaczyna komplikować się jeszcze bardziej. Kasia staje przed wyzwaniem, jakim jest poznanie siebie, swojej przykrej przeszłości, a jednocześnie pogodzenie się z tym, kim naprawdę jest. Losy kobiety splatają się z innymi osobami, które także zmagają się z licznymi problemami i dzięki niej powoli zaczynają odkrywać swoją tożsamość.
